<h2 id="GSW">Golden State Warriors</h2>
<p>The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in Oakland, California. The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. The Warriors play their home games at the Oracle Arena in Oakland. The Warriors have reached nine NBA Finals, winning five NBA championships in 1947,[b] 1956, 1975, 2015 and 2017. Golden State's five NBA championships are tied for fourth-most in NBA history with the San Antonio Spurs, and behind only the Boston Celtics (17), Los Angeles Lakers (16) and Chicago Bulls (6). As of 2017, the Warriors are the third most valuable NBA franchise according to Forbes, with an estimated value of $2.6 billion.[6]

The team was established in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a founding member of the Basketball Association of America (BAA). In 1962, the franchise relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area and was renamed the San Francisco Warriors. In 1971, the team changed its geographic moniker to Golden State, California's state nickname.[7][c] The team is nicknamed the Dubs as a shortening of "W's".[8][9]

Wilt Chamberlain and Stephen Curry have both been named the NBA's Most Valuable Player while playing for the Warriors, for a total of three MVP awards. 18 Hall of Famers have played for the Warriors, while four have coached the team. Golden State holds the NBA records for best regular season with 73–9, best postseason with 16–1 (.941 winning percentage) and most wins in a season (regular season and postseason combined) with 88.</p>

<h2 id="BC">Boston Celtics</h2>
<p>The Boston Celtics are an American professional basketball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division. Founded in 1946 and one of eight NBA teams (out of 23 total teams) to survive the league's first decade, the team is owned by Boston Basketball Partners LLC. The Celtics play their home games at the TD Garden, which they share with the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Boston Bruins. The franchise's 17 championships are the most of any NBA team, and account for 24.3 percent of all NBA championships since the league's founding in 1946.[4] As a percentage of championships won, the Celtics are the most successful franchise to date in the major four traditional North American professional sports leagues.[note 1]

The Celtics have played the Los Angeles Lakers a record 12 times in the finals, including their most recent appearances in 2008 and 2010, where the Celtics have won nine meetings. Four Celtics players (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird) have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for an NBA record total of 10 MVP awards.[5] Their mascot 'Lucky the Leprechaun' is a nod to the team's Irish heritage and to Boston's historically large Irish population.[6]

The Celtics rose again after struggling through the 1990s to win a championship in 2008 with the help of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen in what was known as the new "Big Three" era, following the original "Big Three" era of the 1980s that featured Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish.

After the end of the second "Big Three" era, general manager Danny Ainge began a rebuilding process with the help of new head coach Brad Stevens, who led the Celtics to a return to the playoffs from 2015 to 2017. During the 2016–17 season, the Celtics clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. They faced the Chicago Bulls in the first round and then the Washington Wizards in the second round winning in 7 games. The Boston Celtics then lost in the Eastern Conference Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 5 games after Isaiah Thomas was injured.</p>
